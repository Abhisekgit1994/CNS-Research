Deep learning for cellular image analysis

Step 1 : have loaded and preprocessed the images using torch.ImageLoader and torch.transform.
for part1 : Developed a transfer learning model using torch and Inception_v3 with Imagenet weights and tried to udpate the weights based on highest accuracy on training data.the model gave around 77% accuracy on test data.
part2 : Created and CNN from scratch with 2 Conv2d and 2 maxpool2d and 3 linear layers including the output layer. with 2 trials and 2 runs the average test accuracy was 25%.

Q3: is written in the notebook itself.

Q4 : Attaching the summary doc as a file in the repository.


Thank you.
